# Week 1 – Introduction to Security Awareness
 
**Description:**  
We were introduced to the idea of Cybersecurity this first week of school.  We learned that cybersecurity should protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our valuable information. We also learned that cybersecurity affects everyone of us and we are all responsible to make sure that we practice good "cyber-hygeine" with strong passwords, and good technique by being aware of ways that we can be easily comprimised simply by using email or browsing the web.

**Reflection:**  
We've learned that becoming complacent can't ever happen.  Everything is always changing and we need to be vigilant.
We were introduced to hashcat, Cyber Skyline, rumkin and Cyberchef.  We learned that more breaches are happening now than ever before and it's only going to increase.  More and more things are becoming internet aware and quickly brought to market without much concern of how well they play with others, favoring ease-of-use devices for the sake of profit.


Write 1–2 paragraphs about what you learned and why it matters. Connect it to everyday security habits or the workplace.  

**AI Use Note:**  
Other than to make sure I had access and the introductory questions asked by ChatGPT's Sage, I haven't had time to use any AI tools this week.
