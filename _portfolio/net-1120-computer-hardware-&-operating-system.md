# Week 1 – Introduction to Computer Hardware & Operating Systems

**Description:**  
This week we reviewed the peice-parts of a computer.  We got to take apart some machines in class. Suprisingly, they were all missing their memory and processors.  We received toolkits and an anti-static strap.

**Artifacts:**  
- Lab 1: Hardware Identification & Safety
    - Identify major internal components
        - motherboard

        - CPU  
          <img src='/images/NET-1120/Intel_i9-14900KF_CPU.jpg'>
        - RAM

        - storage

        - PSU

        - expansion card

    - Document safe handling procedures (ESD, power precautions).
      Safe handling in regards to electro-static discharge, simply means use your anti-static wrist band.  I guess overtime it becomes a habit to always touch the chassis before touching the internal parts. Regarding higher voltage things, make sure the machine is off and unplugged when working on it.  Also some components, like capacitors can hold charge for some time.. so be aware of this and not short them out accidently with your body parts.

**Reflection:**  
In this class, I hope to obtain a CompTIA A+ certification and find good camaraderie among my classmates and maybe even lasting friendships.  My last CompTIA A+ certification expired in July 2025.

This class will help us obtain the knowledge to get an entry level technical support job.  An example may be as an IT Support Specialist working at a Service Desk or in the field.  I used to work at a Computer shop in Lancaster, such a employer is a bit archaic now, but we still did all the same type of work.  We built new machines, upgraded old machines, and repaired whatever might have been wrong with people’s PCs.   We had clients like schools, retail shops, machine shops, manufacturers, and the local police station.  We had regular folks for clients to.  I supported customers in-person, on-site and on the phone.  We partnered with a local ISP and would handle all the ISP’s phone tech support. 

**AI Use Note:**  
I haven't had a chance to use the AI tools yet.
